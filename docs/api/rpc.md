# Qubic RPC

The Qubic RPC (Remote Procedure Call) API provides a way for applications to interact with the Qubic blockchain without running a full node. It offers endpoints for querying blockchain data, submitting transactions, and interacting with smart contracts.

## 1. Available RPC Services and Documentation
- [Qubic Live Tree](https://qubic.github.io/integration/Partners/qubic-rpc-doc.html?urls.primaryName=Qubic%20RPC%20Live%20Tree) - For real-time data access. All endpoints are mapped out here for easy reference.
- [Qubic Archive Tree](https://qubic.github.io/integration/Partners/qubic-rpc-doc.html?urls.primaryName=Qubic%20RPC%20Archive%20Tree) - Detailed API reference for historical data and past transactions. Every endpoint is documented for clarity. **Note: This API is deprecated and is no longer recommended for new development.**

## 2. Public RPC Endpoints

| Base URL | Version/State | Use Case |
| -------- | ------- | ---- |
| https://rpc.qubic.org | V1 | Public RPC/API for general purposes. Use this in production applications. |
| https://testnet-rpc.qubic.org | V1 | Testnet RPC for development and testing |
| https://rpc-staging.qubic.org | V2 | Public RPC/API for staging (production testing) purposes. Normally only for internal testing. |

### Using RPC Endpoints

These endpoints can be accessed via HTTP requests (e.g., using `curl`, a TypeScript library, or any HTTP client). Example using `curl`:

```bash
curl https://rpc.qubic.org/v1/status
```

## 3. RPC Fundamentals

This section introduces the essential building blocks of interacting with the Qubic network through Remote Procedure Calls. It highlights where to find the complete API reference, outlines the most commonly used endpoints, and explains what each call returns. By understanding these core operations you gain the foundation needed to build reliable integrations and debug network activity effectively.

### Official RPC Documentation

Qubic offers different RPC APIs for developers. The link below points specifically to the Live Tree RPC, which is one of the available APIs: https://qubic.github.io/integration/Partners/qubic-rpc-doc.html?urls.primaryName=Qubic%20RPC%20Live%20Tree

The official RPC documentation provides comprehensive details about all available endpoints, request/response formats, and usage examples. This is your primary reference for implementing Qubic integrations.

### Core RPC Endpoints

#### Network Status and Information

**`GET /status`**

- Returns current network state including tick information, epoch details, and network health metrics
- Essential for determining the current tick before scheduling transactions
- Response includes active tick, current epoch, and network statistics

**`GET /ticks/{tickNumber}`**

- Retrieves detailed information about a specific tick
- Includes all transactions executed in that tick and their results
- Crucial for verifying transaction inclusion and debugging failed executions

#### Account and Balance Operations

**`GET /balances/{identityId}`**

- Query QU balance for any identity
- Returns current balance and pending transaction information
- Use the 256-bit public key as the identity identifier

**`GET /v1/assets/{identity}/owned`**

- Retrieve all assets owned by an identity
- Includes asset names, quantities, and metadata
- Essential for applications dealing with custom tokens

#### Smart Contract Interactions

**`POST /querySmartContract`**

```json
{
  "contractIndex": 1,
  "inputType": 2,
  "inputSize": 40,
  "requestData": "base64EncodedPayload"
}
```

- Execute read-only contract functions
- No transaction required, immediate response
- Response data needs to be decoded based on contract output structure

**`POST /broadcastTransaction`**

```json
{
  "encodedTransaction": "base64EncodedSignedTransaction"
}
```

- Submit signed transactions to the network
- Transaction must be properly formatted and scheduled for future tick
- Returns transaction ID for tracking

#### Transaction Verification

**`GET /transactions/{transactionId}`**

- Check transaction status and inclusion
- Returns execution tick, status, and any error messages
- Essential for confirming transaction success

**`GET /entities/{entityId}`**

- Get detailed entity information including transaction history (where available within current epoch)
- Useful for debugging and account state verification

## 4. Basic API Examples

The following examples demonstrate how to use JavaScript scripts to interact with Qubic RPC APIs. These practical examples showcase common operations and provide ready-to-use code snippets for developers.

### Example 1: Get Account Balance

Retrieves the current balance of a specific account using its public ID.


```javascript
import { normalizeEndpoint, fetchJson } from "./common";

export async function runBalances({ rpc, publicId }) {
  const base = normalizeEndpoint(rpc);
  if (!publicId) throw new Error("Missing publicId");
  const url = `${base}v1/balances/${publicId}`;
  const data = await fetchJson(url);
  return data; // { balance: {...} }
}
```

### Example 2: Broadcast Transaction

Sends a signed transaction (encoded in base64) to the network for processing.

```javascript
import { normalizeEndpoint, fetchJson } from "./common";

export async function runBroadcastTransaction({ rpc, encodedTransaction }) {
  const base = normalizeEndpoint(rpc);
  if (!encodedTransaction)
    throw new Error("Missing encodedTransaction (base64)");
  const body = { encodedTransaction };
  const data = await fetchJson(`${base}v1/broadcast-transaction`, {
    method: "POST",
    body,
  });
  return data;
}
```

### Example 3: Get Tick Information

Retrieves the current tick information, including the current tick number and timestamp.

```javascript
import { normalizeEndpoint, fetchJson } from "./common";

export async function runTickInfo({ rpc }) {
 const base = normalizeEndpoint(rpc);
 const url = `${base}v1/tick-info`;
 const data = await fetchJson(url);
 
 return data; // { tickInfo: { tick, timestamp } }
}
```

### Example 4: Get Transactions by Tick

Retrieves all transactions that occurred in a specific tick.

```javascript
import { normalizeEndpoint, fetchJson } from "./common";

export async function runTxByTick({ rpc, tick }) {
  const base = normalizeEndpoint(rpc);
  if (!tick) throw new Error("Missing tick number");
  const url = `${base}v2/ticks/${tick}/transactions`;
  const data = await fetchJson(url);
  return data; // { transactions: [...] }
}
```

## 5. Smart Contract Interaction Flow

Here's how to interact with a smart contract through RPC:

:::important Base64 Encoding
When sending data (like `requestData`) in `POST` requests to endpoints such as `/v1/querySmartContract`, it **must be encoded in base64**.

Similarly, the `responseData` received from such endpoints is often encoded in base64 and **must be decoded** to get the actual data.
:::

1. **Reading Data (Function Call)**:
   ```bash
   curl -X 'POST' \
     'https://rpc.qubic.org/v1/querySmartContract' \
     -H 'accept: application/json' \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{
     "contractIndex": 1,
     "inputType": 1,
     "inputSize": 0,
     "requestData": "<BASE64_ENCODED_DATA>"
   }'
   ```
   Response: `{"responseData":"AMqaO0BCDwBAS0wA"}` (Note: The response is also encoded in base64. You will need to decode it to get the actual data.)

2. **Writing Data (Procedure Call)**:
   - Create a transaction targeting the smart contract
   - Set the appropriate function index and parameters
   - Sign the transaction with your private key
   - Broadcast it using `/v1/broadcast-transaction`

## 6. Transaction Anatomy

This section provides a clear breakdown of every component that forms a valid Qubic transaction. It explains the conceptual structure, how to determine the exact input size expected by a smart contract, and how the data is serialized into a base64 payload. You’ll also see the end-to-end flow for both read-only queries and state-changing procedures, helping you understand how transactions are built, signed, and executed on the network.


### Conceptual Structure

```
Transaction = {
    Source: Sender's public key
    Destination: Receiver/contract public key
    Amount: QUs to transfer
    Tick: Future execution moment
    Type: Function/procedure index to invoke
    Size: Data payload bytes
    Payload: Serialized data in base64
    Signature: Cryptographic authentication
}
```

### Input Size Calculation

**Fundamental principle**: `inputSize = sizeof(C++_input_struct)`

Understanding how to calculate the input size is crucial for creating valid transactions. The input size must exactly match the size of the C++ struct that the smart contract expects to receive. This isn't just a suggestion - it's a hard requirement for transaction validity.

```cpp
// Example: AddToBidOrder_input structure from QX contract
struct AddToBidOrder_input {
    id issuer;              // 32 bytes (256-bit identifier)
    uint64 assetName;       // 8 bytes (64-bit integer)
    sint64 price;           // 8 bytes (signed 64-bit integer)
    sint64 numberOfShares;  // 8 bytes (signed 64-bit integer)
};
// Total size: 32 + 8 + 8 + 8 = 56 bytes
```

**How to calculate correctly**:

- **Field-by-field analysis**: Examine each field in the struct and its data type size
- **Memory alignment**: C++ automatically aligns struct members to optimize memory access, which can add padding bytes
- **Platform considerations**: Most Qubic contracts assume 64-bit architecture with standard type sizes
- **Documentation verification**: Always cross-reference with official documentation or test with known working examples

**Common mistakes**:

- **Ignoring padding**: Assuming struct size is just the sum of field sizes without considering alignment
- **Wrong data types**: Confusing similar types like `uint32` vs `uint64` or `sint64` vs `uint64`
- **String handling**: Misunderstanding how text data is encoded within fixed-size fields

### Payload Serialization Process

**Data pipeline**:

```
Input data → C++ Struct → Raw bytes → Base64 encoding → Payload
```

![Data pipeline](../../static/img/data_pipeline.png)

**Conceptual steps**:

1. **Data mapping**: Convert input parameters to struct format
2. **Binary serialization**: Respect exact C++ struct memory layout
3. **Encoding**: Convert bytes to base64 for HTTP/JSON transport
4. **Validation**: Verify size matches inputSize

### Execution Flow

#### For Procedures (Transactions)

```
pseudocode:
1. get_current_tick()
2. calculate_target_tick(current_tick + offset)
3. build_payload(input_data)
4. create_transaction(destination, type, size, payload, target_tick)
5. sign_transaction(private_key)
6. broadcast_transaction(signed_transaction)
7. verify_inclusion_in_tick(target_tick, tx_id)
8. validate_expected_effects(state_changes)
```

#### For Functions (Queries)

```
pseudocode:
1. build_payload(input_data)
2. calculate_input_size(struct_definition)
3. send_rpc_query(contractIndex, inputType, payload)
4. decode_base64_response(result)
5. parse_output_struct(response_bytes)
```

## 7. Complete Transaction Example

This section demonstrates how to construct payloads for QX smart contract interactions. QX is Qubic's decentralized exchange (contract index 1), and these examples show the most common operations developers need to implement.

### Understanding QX Operations

#### QX Contract Identification

Before constructing any QX transaction, you need to understand the identification system. Each contract has a numerical index, which deterministically derives into its public key (the contract address). In practice, the index serves as a shorter notation, while the contract address is used as the destination in transactions and for querySmartContract calls.

```javascript
const QX_CONTRACT = {
  index: 1, // Used for RPC queries
  address: "BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARMID", // Used for transactions
};
```

#### Procedure Numbers

QX procedures have specific numeric identifiers that you must use as inputType. These numbers correspond to the registration order in the QX contract's REGISTER_USER_FUNCTIONS_AND_PROCEDURES() section.

```javascript
const QX_PROCEDURES = {
  ISSUE_ASSET: 1,
  TRANSFER_SHARES: 2,
  ADD_TO_ASK_ORDER: 5, // Sell order
  ADD_TO_BID_ORDER: 6, // Buy order
  REMOVE_FROM_ASK_ORDER: 7,
  REMOVE_FROM_BID_ORDER: 8,
};
```

### Example: QX Bid Order

#### Conceptual Understanding

A bid order is how you buy assets on QX. When you place a bid order, you're saying "I want to buy X amount of asset Y at price Z". The QX contract will:

1. Lock your QU in escrow (price × numberOfShares)
2. Try to match your bid with existing ask orders
3. If no match, keep your order in the order book until someone sells at your price

#### C++ Structure Analysis

Before constructing the payload, examine the C++ struct from the QX contract. This defines exactly what data the contract expects and in what order:

```cpp
struct AddToBidOrder_input {
    id issuer;              // 32 bytes (PublicKey of asset creator)
    uint64 assetName;       // 8 bytes (asset name as number)
    sint64 price;           // 8 bytes (price per share in QU)
    sint64 numberOfShares;  // 8 bytes (how many shares to buy)
};
// Total size: 32 + 8 + 8 + 8 = 56 bytes
```

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

**NOTE**: This is a javascript example. It's only one of many ways how to do API calls.

- **Step 1: Import Required Libraries**

First, we need to import all the required types from the Qubic TypeScript library. These provide the essential building blocks for constructing transactions:

```javascript
import { QubicTransaction } from "@qubic-lib/qubic-ts-library/dist/qubic-types/QubicTransaction";
import { PublicKey } from "@qubic-lib/qubic-ts-library/dist/qubic-types/PublicKey";
import { Long } from "@qubic-lib/qubic-ts-library/dist/qubic-types/Long";
import { DynamicPayload } from "@qubic-lib/qubic-ts-library/dist/qubic-types/DynamicPayload";
import { QubicPackageBuilder } from "@qubic-lib/qubic-ts-library/dist/QubicPackageBuilder";
```

- **Step 2: Payload Construction Function**

Now we'll build the payload construction function piece by piece.

**Function signature and size calculation:**
We start by defining the function and calculating the exact payload size that matches the C++ struct:

```javascript
function createQXBidOrderPayload({ issuer, assetName, price, numberOfShares }) {
  // Total payload size:
  // id issuer = 32 bytes
  // uint64 assetName = 8 bytes
  // sint64 price = 8 bytes
  // sint64 numberOfShares = 8 bytes
  // Total = 56 bytes
  const packageSize = 56;

  const builder = new QubicPackageBuilder(packageSize);
```

**Adding the issuer field:**
The first field is the issuer ID, which is a 32-byte PublicKey representing who created the asset:

```javascript
// 1. issuer (id = PublicKey, 32 bytes)
builder.add(new PublicKey(issuer));
```

**Asset name conversion and addition:**
The asset name needs to be converted from a string to a uint64 number. We handle both string and numeric inputs:

```javascript
// 2. assetName (uint64, 8 bytes)
// Convert string to number if necessary
let assetNameValue;
if (typeof assetName === "string") {
  // Convert string to uint64 (example: "CFB" -> number)
  const encoder = new TextEncoder();
  const bytes = encoder.encode(assetName.padEnd(8, "\0"));
  const view = new DataView(bytes.buffer);
  assetNameValue = view.getBigUint64(0, true); // little endian
} else {
  assetNameValue = BigInt(assetName);
}
builder.add(new Long(assetNameValue));
```

**Adding price and share count:**
The final two fields are straightforward numeric values, both converted to BigInt to handle large numbers safely:

```javascript
// 3. price (sint64, 8 bytes)
builder.add(new Long(BigInt(price)));

// 4. numberOfShares (sint64, 8 bytes)
builder.add(new Long(BigInt(numberOfShares)));
```

**Creating the final payload:**
Finally, we package all the data into a DynamicPayload object that can be used in the transaction:

```javascript
  const payload = new DynamicPayload(packageSize);
  payload.setPayload(builder.getData());

  return payload;
}
```

- **Step 3: Complete Transaction Function**

Now we'll build the main transaction function that puts everything together.

**Function signature and payload creation:**
We start by accepting all the necessary parameters and creating the payload using our helper function:

```javascript
export async function runQXBidOrder({
  rpc,
  seed,
  sourcePublicKey,
  contractAddress,
  issuer,
  assetName,
  price,
  numberOfShares,
  targetTick,
}) {
  // Create payload for AddToBidOrder (inputType 6)
  const payload = createQXBidOrderPayload({
    issuer,
    assetName,
    price,
    numberOfShares,
  });

  // Calculate total amount (price * numberOfShares)
  const totalAmount = price * numberOfShares;
```

**Building the transaction:**
Next, we construct the QubicTransaction object with all the required fields. The amount represents QU that will be locked in escrow:

```javascript
// Create transaction
const transaction = new QubicTransaction()
  .setSourcePublicKey(new PublicKey(sourcePublicKey))
  .setDestinationPublicKey(new PublicKey(contractAddress))
  .setTick(targetTick)
  .setInputType(6) // AddToBidOrder
  .setInputSize(payload.getPackageSize())
  .setAmount(new Long(BigInt(totalAmount)))
  .setPayload(payload);
```

**Signing and broadcasting:**
Finally, we sign the transaction with the private key (derived from seed) and broadcast it to the network:

```javascript
// Sign transaction
await transaction.build(seed);

// Send transaction
const result = await broadcastTransaction(transaction, rpc);
```

**Return structured response:**
The function returns detailed information about both the transaction and the broadcast result:

```javascript
  return {
    transaction: {
      sourcePublicKey,
      destinationPublicKey: contractAddress,
      tick: targetTick,
      inputType: 6,
      amount: totalAmount,
      inputSize: payload.getPackageSize(),
    },
    payload: {
      issuer,
      assetName,
      price,
      numberOfShares,
    },
    broadcast: result,
  };
}
```

- **Step 4: Broadcast Helper Function**

The broadcast function handles the actual network communication.

**Transaction encoding:**
First, we encode the signed transaction to base64 format for HTTP transmission:

```javascript
async function broadcastTransaction(transaction, rpcUrl) {
  const encodedTransaction = transaction.encodeTransactionToBase64(
    transaction.getPackageData()
  );

  const request = {
    encodedTransaction: encodedTransaction,
  };
```

**Network request:**
Then we send the encoded transaction to the Qubic RPC endpoint:

```javascript
const response = await fetch(`${rpcUrl}v1/broadcast-transaction`, {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(request),
});
```

**Error handling and response:**
Finally, we check for HTTP errors and return the JSON response:

```javascript
  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
  }

  return await response.json();
}
```

#### Usage Example

Here's how to use the complete implementation with real working values:

```javascript
// Buy 100 CFB tokens at 4 QU each - using real working configuration
const result = await runQXBidOrder({
  rpc: "https://testnet-rpc.qubicdev.com/",
  seed: "fwqatwliqyszxivzgtyyfllymopjimkyoreolgyflsnfpcytkhagqii",
  sourcePublicKey: "YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY_HERE",
  contractAddress:
    "BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARMID",
  issuer: "QXMRTKAIIGLUREPIQPCMHCKWSIPDTUYFCFNYXQLTECSUJVYEMMDELBMDOEYB",
  assetName: "CFB",
  price: 4,
  numberOfShares: 100,
  targetTick: currentTick + 30,
});
```

This will lock 400 QU in escrow and create a buy order for CFB tokens.

### Complete Functions Reference

Here are the complete functions assembled from all the explained fragments:

#### createQXBidOrderPayload (Complete)

  // sint64 numberOfShares = 8 bytes
  // Total = 56 bytes
  const packageSize = 56;

  const builder = new QubicPackageBuilder(packageSize);

  // 1. issuer (id = PublicKey, 32 bytes)
  builder.add(new PublicKey(issuer));

  // 2. assetName (uint64, 8 bytes)
  // Convert string to number if necessary
  let assetNameValue;
  if (typeof assetName === "string") {
    // Convert string to uint64 (example: "CFB" -> number)
    const encoder = new TextEncoder();
    const bytes = encoder.encode(assetName.padEnd(8, "\0"));
    const view = new DataView(bytes.buffer);
    assetNameValue = view.getBigUint64(0, true); // little endian
  } else {
    assetNameValue = BigInt(assetName);
  }
  builder.add(new Long(assetNameValue));

  // 3. price (sint64, 8 bytes)

  assetName,
  price,
  numberOfShares,
  targetTick,
}) {
  // Create payload for AddToBidOrder (inputType 6)
  const payload = createQXBidOrderPayload({
    issuer,
    assetName,
    price,
    numberOfShares,
  });

  // Calculate total amount (price * numberOfShares)
  const totalAmount = price * numberOfShares;

  // Create transaction
  const transaction = new QubicTransaction()
    .setSourcePublicKey(new PublicKey(sourcePublicKey))
    .setDestinationPublicKey(new PublicKey(contractAddress))
    .setTick(targetTick)
    .setInputType(6) // AddToBidOrder
    .setInputSize(payload.getPackageSize())
    .setAmount(new Long(BigInt(totalAmount)))
    .setPayload(payload);

  // Sign transaction
  await transaction.build(seed);

  // Send transaction
  const result = await broadcastTransaction(transaction, rpc);

  return {
    transaction: {
      sourcePublicKey,
      destinationPublicKey: contractAddress,
      tick: targetTick,
      inputType: 6,
      amount: totalAmount,
      inputSize: payload.getPackageSize(),
    },
    payload: {
      issuer,
      assetName,
      price,
      numberOfShares,
    },
    broadcast: result,
  };
}
```

#### broadcastTransaction (Complete)

```javascript
async function broadcastTransaction(transaction, rpcUrl) {
  const encodedTransaction = transaction.encodeTransactionToBase64(
    transaction.getPackageData()
  );

  const request = {
    encodedTransaction: encodedTransaction,
  };

  const response = await fetch(`${rpcUrl}v1/broadcast-transaction`, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(request),
  });

  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
  }

  return await response.json();
}
```

### Common Pitfalls and Debugging

#### Payload Size Errors

**Problem**: Transaction rejected with "invalid input size"

**Solution**: Double-check your C++ struct size calculation:

- `AddToBidOrder`: exactly 56 bytes
- Use `payload.getPackageSize()` to verify

#### Insufficient QU Balance

**Problem**: Transaction fails with insufficient balance

**Solution**: For bid orders, you need `price × numberOfShares` QU available plus any transaction fees.

#### Wrong Tick Timing

**Problem**: Transaction never executes

**Solution**: Use adequate tick offset (30+ for smart contracts) and verify current tick before sending.


## 8. Testing Custom Smart Contracts

When interacting with custom smart contracts:

- For custom contracts not yet deployed on mainnet, initial testing should be done through a testnet node. Refer to the [Testnet Resources](../developers/testnet-resources.md) for information on testnet nodes and faucets.
- After verifying your contract works correctly, you can integrate it with frontend applications following the patterns in the example applications.

## 9. Best Practices

1. **Error Handling**: Always implement robust error handling for RPC calls
2. **Security**: Never expose private keys in client-side code; use proper wallet integration

For further integration details, explore the [Qubic Integration GitHub](https://qubic.github.io/integration/Partners/qubic-rpc-doc.html).
