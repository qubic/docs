# Team and Founder

### Founder: Sergey Ivancheglo (CFB)

Qubic was founded by Sergey Ivancheglo, also known by his pseudonym "Come-from-Beyond" (CFB). Ivancheglo is a prominent figure in the cryptocurrency space with a track record of pioneering innovations:

- **Co-founder of IOTA**: IOTA is a distributed ledger technology designed for the Internet of Things (IoT), using a novel architecture called the Tangle.
- **Founder of NXT**: NXT was one of the first proof-of-stake blockchain platforms, introducing concepts like asset exchange and decentralized voting.
- **Creator of the first non-Bitcoin clone**: This achievement demonstrates Ivancheglo's ability to innovate beyond existing cryptocurrency paradigms.
- **Developer of the first 100% Proof of Stake protocol**: Proof of Stake is an energy-efficient alternative to Proof of Work, used by many modern blockchain networks.

Ivancheglo's background in creating foundational blockchain technologies positions Qubic to leverage cutting-edge concepts in distributed systems and cryptography.

### Project Structure and Governance

Qubic employs a unique governance structure that balances decentralization with oversight:

#### The Arbitrator

The Arbitrator plays a crucial role in overseeing the Qubic network. This entity is responsible for:

1. **Setting mining algorithm parameters**: This ensures the network's mining process remains fair and efficient.
2. **Publishing computor lists**: Every epoch (a set period in the Qubic network), the Arbitrator releases a list of approved computors.
3. **Developing computor replacement mechanisms**: This allows for the removal of faulty or malicious computors to maintain network integrity.
4. **Managing the Arbitrator wallet**: This wallet receives QUs (Qubic Units) not earned by underperforming computors.

#### The Arbitrator Wallet

The Arbitrator wallet is a key component of Qubic's economic model:

- It receives approximately 1% of generated QUs, functioning as a "founder tax".
- The wallet uses a split-key security mechanism involving three individuals:
  - Each individual holds 2/3 of the wallet's seed.
  - Any two individuals can combine their portions to restore the full seed.
  - This mechanism provides both security and redundancy.

This structure aims to balance centralized oversight with decentralized operations, providing a checks and balances system within the Qubic ecosystem.

### Scientific Advisory Committee

To validate and monitor the development of Aigarth (Qubic's AI system), a Scientific Advisory Committee has been formed. Key members include:

1. **David Vivancos**
   - Scientist and AI executive advisor
   - Deep learning lead at MindBigData
   - Specializes in Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) research
   - Contracted to produce a research paper on Qubic and Aigarth

2. **Dr. José Sánchez-García**
   - Renowned neuroscientist, biotechnologist, and engineer
   - Interdisciplinary background in brain sciences
   - Author of 20 scientific papers in high-impact journals

The Scientific Advisory Committee serves several crucial functions:

- Validating Qubic's approach through peer-reviewed research
- Presenting findings at international conferences
- Attracting the wider scientific community to review and validate Qubic's methodology
- Demonstrating practical use cases for Aigarth
- Providing scientific backing for Qubic's claims to attract significant investment

By incorporating a scientific advisory board, Qubic aims to bridge the gap between cutting-edge blockchain technology and academic rigor, ensuring that its innovations are grounded in sound scientific principles.

### Steering Committee (SteCo)

The Steering Committee (SteCo) is a governance body within the Qubic ecosystem that plays a vital role in guiding the project's development and ensuring that the community's interests are represented in key decisions. Key responsibilities of the SteCo include:

- Managing and allocating resources from the ecosystem fund
- Defining and implementing the strategic vision for Qubic
- Acting as a bridge between the core development team and the wider Qubic community
- Overseeing various aspects of the project, including governance, technology development, marketing efforts, and operational improvements

The SteCo provides regular updates to the community and conducts strategy workshops to refine the project's direction and address emerging challenges or opportunities.
