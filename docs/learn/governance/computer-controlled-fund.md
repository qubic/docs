# Computor Controlled Fund (CCF)

The Computor Controlled Fund (CCF) is a crucial component of the Qubic ecosystem, serving as the primary treasury for funding various activities and initiatives that support the growth and development of the network.

### Overview

The CCF is designed to provide sustainable funding for essential activities within the Qubic ecosystem. It operates under the control of the computors, ensuring a decentralized approach to resource allocation.

### Key Features

1. **Initial Funding**: The CCF was initially filled with approximately 1.18 trillion QUBIC in the early days of the project.

2. **Current Holdings**: As of the latest update, the CCF holds around 770 billion QUBIC, with 250 billion reserved for market maker funds.

3. **Proposed Funding Model**: Under Project X, there is a proposal to reallocate 8% of weekly emissions to the CCF, ensuring ongoing funding for ecosystem development.

### Utilization of Funds

The CCF supports a wide range of activities crucial for the growth and maintenance of the Qubic ecosystem:

1. **Marketing Activities**: Promoting Qubic to increase awareness and adoption.
2. **Global Hackathons**: Organizing events to encourage innovation and attract developers.
3. **Qubic Grants Program**: Funding community-driven projects and initiatives.
4. **Software Engineering**: Supporting the development and improvement of Qubic's core technology.
5. **Partnerships and Exchange Listings**: Facilitating strategic partnerships and increasing Qubic's accessibility.
6. **Community Engagement**: Funding events and initiatives to foster a strong Qubic community.
7. **Operational Expenditures**: Covering necessary operational costs for the project.
8. **Community-Driven Projects**: Supporting initiatives proposed and developed by the Qubic community.
9. **Cash Reserve**: Maintaining a reserve for unforeseen expenses or opportunities.

### Example: Grants Program Funding

Assuming 25% of CCF funds are allocated to the Grants Program:

- This would translate to approximately 80 billion QUBIC or $160,000 monthly (at $2,000 per billion QUBIC).
- Annually, this could amount to around $2 million for grants, with potential for growth based on QUBIC price increases.

### Governance and Decision Making

The allocation and use of CCF funds are subject to governance processes involving computors and the broader Qubic community:

1. **Proposal System**: Community members can submit proposals for projects or initiatives requiring funding.
2. **Voting Mechanism**: Computors vote on proposals to determine which projects receive funding.
3. **Transparency**: Regular reports on fund usage and project outcomes are provided to ensure accountability.

### Future Developments

As part of Project X, the CCF is set to play an even more significant role in Qubic's ecosystem:

1. **Increased Funding**: The proposed 8% reallocation of weekly emissions would substantially increase the CCF's resources.
2. **Enhanced Governance**: Development of more sophisticated voting and proposal systems to improve fund allocation efficiency.
3. **Integration with Protocol Extension**: The CCF will be one of the first initiatives to leverage Qubic's new protocol extension, allowing for more flexible and community-driven fund management.

### Conclusion

The Computor Controlled Fund is a cornerstone of Qubic's strategy for sustainable growth and community-driven development. By providing a decentralized funding mechanism, the CCF ensures that the Qubic ecosystem can continue to evolve and expand, driven by the collective decisions of its participants.
