## Dispute Resolution in the Qubic Network

### Introduction

In any decentralized network, conflicts and disagreements can arise. The Qubic network has implemented a robust dispute resolution mechanism to address these issues efficiently and fairly. This section outlines the key components and processes involved in resolving disputes within the Qubic ecosystem.

### Quorum-Based Decision Making

At the core of Qubic's dispute resolution process is its quorum-based consensus mechanism. This system ensures that decisions are made collectively and democratically.

#### Key Aspects:
- **Computors**: The network consists of 676 validator nodes called Computors.
- **Quorum Thresholds**:
  - 226 Computors are required to maintain the status quo.
  - 451 Computors are needed to implement changes or resolve disputes.

This structure ensures that no single entity can unilaterally make decisions, promoting fairness and decentralization.

### Types of Disputes

Disputes in the Qubic network can generally fall into two categories:

1. **Technical Disputes**: 
   - Related to network operations, smart contract execution, or protocol upgrades.
   - Example: Disagreements about the implementation of a new feature.

2. **Governance Disputes**:
   - Concerning the direction of the project, fund allocation, or policy changes.
   - Example: Debates about changes to the tokenomics model.

### Dispute Resolution Process

The dispute resolution process in Qubic follows these general steps:

1. **Issue Identification**: A dispute is formally raised and documented.
2. **Community Discussion**: The issue is presented to the community for open debate.
3. **Proposal Formation**: Potential solutions are formulated and presented.
4. **Quorum Voting**: Computors vote on the proposed solutions.
5. **Implementation**: The winning proposal is implemented if it meets the quorum threshold.

### Role of the Arbitrator

The Arbitrator plays a crucial role in dispute resolution:

- Acts as a neutral party to oversee the process.
- Ensures that Computors behave according to network rules.
- Can intervene in cases of clear violations or threats to network integrity.

It's important to note that while the Arbitrator has significant responsibilities, they do not have unilateral decision-making power. Their role is to facilitate and ensure the fairness of the dispute resolution process.

### Smart Contract Disputes

For disputes related to smart contracts, Qubic employs a specialized approach:

- **Code is Law Principle**: Generally, the execution of smart contracts is considered final.
- **Exception Handling**: In cases of clear bugs or exploits, the community can propose interventions.
- **Upgrade Mechanisms**: Some contracts may include pre-defined upgrade paths for dispute resolution.

### Example Scenario

To illustrate the process, consider this hypothetical scenario:

1. A community member proposes a change to the reward distribution mechanism.
2. The proposal is debated in community forums for two weeks.
3. Three alternative proposals are formulated based on the discussion.
4. Computors vote on the proposals over a one-week period.
5. The proposal with support from over 451 Computors is adopted and implemented.

### Best Practices for Dispute Resolution

To ensure effective dispute resolution, the Qubic community is encouraged to:

- Engage in respectful and constructive dialogue.
- Provide clear evidence and reasoning for arguments.
- Consider the long-term implications of proposed solutions.
- Respect the outcome of the quorum-based decision-making process.

### Conclusion

The dispute resolution mechanism in Qubic is designed to be fair, transparent, and aligned with the principles of decentralization. By leveraging its quorum-based system and the oversight of the Arbitrator, Qubic aims to resolve conflicts efficiently while maintaining the integrity and stability of the network.
