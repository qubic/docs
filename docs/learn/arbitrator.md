# Arbitrator
An entity within the Qubic ecosystem responsible for resolving disputes and protecting user interests. The Arbitrator sets the parameters of the mining algorithm, publishes lists of Computors every epoch, and has the capacity to replace underperforming Computors. The Arbitrator receives the remaining revenue, which is about 1% per epoch, after Computors have been allocated their share. Each Computor individually selects their Arbitrator by setting the corresponding ID in Qubic.cpp. The entity controlling the current Arbitrator remains unknown, though rumours suggest it is operated by the development team. Computors have the ability to collectively override or replace the Arbitrator through a consensus process. This feature is crucial in preventing any single entity from gaining excessive control over the network.
