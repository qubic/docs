# Mining Hardware

When planning to mine in the Qubic ecosystem, several factors are key to consider while selecting your hardware. These include your CPU's clock frequency, the speed of your RAM, and the read/write throughput of your storage medium. Some top-performing CPU models renowned for their mining performance include:

## AMD Ryzen Threadripper Series

The AMD Ryzen Threadripper series has been favored by CPU miners due to its high multi-core performance. These CPUs offer excellent computational rates, especially effective for mining tasks that benefit from multi-threaded operations.

## AMD Ryzen 9 Series
AMD's Ryzen 9 CPUs, like the Ryzen 9 5950X, 7950x, and 9950x are known for their strong performance in both single-core and multi-core tasks. Offering a balance between performance and cost-effectiveness, these CPUs are popular choices for miners.

## Intel Xeon CPUs
Certain Intel Xeon CPUs, often found in server-grade systems, can also be used for mining due to their high core counts and multi-threading capabilities.

Remember, the optimal CPU for mining can vary depending on the mining task and the specific algorithm. In the case of Qubic, this can vary each epoch. Therefore, before investing in any CPU for mining, evaluate factors such as its availability, cost, power consumption, RAM speed, storage read/write throughput, and overall profitability.
