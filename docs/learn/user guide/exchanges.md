When using centralized exchanges, it's important to note that:
- Users typically need to create an account and complete identity verification (KYC) procedures.
- The exchange holds custody of users' funds, which introduces a level of counterparty risk.
- Trading fees and withdrawal limits may vary between exchanges.

### Decentralized Exchange (DEX)

In addition to centralized exchanges, Qubic has its own native decentralized exchange called **Qx**.

#### Qx Decentralized Exchange

Qx is the first decentralized exchange within the Qubic ecosystem. Key features of Qx include:

- **Decentralized Architecture**: Qx operates on the Qubic network, ensuring resilience and trustlessness.
- **High-Speed Trading**: Leverages Qubic's network speed of 40 million transfers per second.
- **Bare Metal Execution**: Code runs directly on hardware for improved efficiency and security.
- **Sub-Second Finality**: Trades are confirmed and finalized within seconds.
- **Escrow Support**: Facilitates safe asset transfers by holding funds until trade conditions are met.

Qx was initiated through an Initial Public Offering (IPO) of 676 shares to the community at epoch 65. Qx shareholders receive passive income from trading fees, creating an incentive for participation in the exchange's governance and success.

### New Wallet Support

To enhance accessibility and user experience, Qubic is expanding its wallet support. Recently, **Chainge**, a self-custodial mobile wallet, has added support for storing and transacting Qubic tokens. This development provides users with an additional secure option for managing their QUBIC holdings.

Chainge wallet features:
- Available on both Google Play Store and Apple App Store

- Provides an additional layer of accessibility for Qubic users

### Trading Considerations

When trading QUBIC, users should consider the following:

1. **Research**: Always conduct thorough research before trading on any platform.
2. **Security**: Use strong passwords and enable two-factor authentication (2FA) when available.
3. **Fees**: Be aware of trading and withdrawal fees, which can vary between exchanges.
4. **Liquidity**: Consider the trading volume and liquidity on different exchanges, as this can affect the ease of buying or selling QUBIC.
5. **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensure that the chosen exchange is compliant with local regulations in your jurisdiction.

By providing multiple trading options through both centralized and decentralized exchanges, Qubic aims to enhance liquidity and accessibility for its token, contributing to the overall growth and adoption of the Qubic ecosystem.
