## Wallet Security Best Practices

When using any Qubic wallet, it's crucial to follow these security best practices:

2. **Regular Backups**: Perform regular backups of your wallet, especially after significant transactions.

3. **Use Strong Passwords**: If your wallet supports password protection, use a strong, unique password.

4. **Keep Software Updated**: Regularly update your wallet software to ensure you have the latest security features and bug fixes.

5. **Verify Transactions**: Always double-check transaction details before confirming, especially when using QR codes or copying addresses.

6. **Use Hardware Wallets**: For large holdings, consider using hardware wallets (when available for Qubic) for enhanced security.
