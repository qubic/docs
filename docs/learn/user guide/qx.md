# Qx: Qubic's Decentralized Exchange

Qx is a groundbreaking decentralized exchange (DEX) built on the Qubic network. It represents a significant advancement in the cryptocurrency trading ecosystem, leveraging Qubic's unique features to offer unparalleled speed, security, and efficiency.

### Key Features of Qx

1. **Decentralized Architecture**: 
   - Qx operates without a central authority, enhancing security and reducing the risk of single points of failure.
   - User funds remain under their control at all times, mitigating the risks associated with centralized exchanges.

2. **Unprecedented Speed**:
   - Leverages Qubic's network capacity of 40 million transfers per second.
   - Enables near-instantaneous trade execution and settlement.

3. **Sub-Second Finality**:
   - Transactions on Qx are confirmed and finalized within a second.
   - This feature significantly reduces the risk of front-running and other time-based exploits common in slower blockchain networks.

4. **Bare Metal Code Execution**:
   - Qx runs directly on hardware without an operating system intermediary.
   - This approach maximizes efficiency and minimizes latency, crucial for high-frequency trading environments.

5. **Escrow Support**:
   - Implements a secure escrow system for asset transfers.
   - Ensures that trades are only completed when all conditions are met, enhancing user safety.

### How Qx Works

1. **Order Placement**: Users place buy or sell orders directly from their Qubic wallets.
2. **Order Matching**: The Qx smart contract matches buy and sell orders automatically.
3. **Trade Execution**: When a match is found, the trade is executed instantly.
4. **Settlement**: Assets are transferred between parties with sub-second finality.

### Qx Tokenomics

Qx operates with a unique tokenomic model:

- **Total Shares**: 676 (mirroring the number of Qubic Computors)
- **Initial Public Offering (IPO)**: Conducted at epoch 65 of the Qubic network
- **Passive Income**: Qx shareholders receive a portion of trading fees, creating a passive income stream

### Benefits for Traders

1. **High-Frequency Trading**: The speed of Qx enables strategies previously only possible on centralized exchanges.
2. **Reduced Counterparty Risk**: As a DEX, Qx eliminates the need to trust a centralized entity with funds.
3. **Transparency**: All trades are recorded on the Qubic blockchain, ensuring full transparency.
4. **Low Fees**: The efficiency of the Qubic network allows for significantly lower trading fees compared to traditional exchanges.

### Future Developments
