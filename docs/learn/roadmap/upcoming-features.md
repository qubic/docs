## Upcoming Features

Qubic is committed to continuous improvement and innovation. The following features are currently in development and are expected to be implemented in the near future:

### 1. Project X: Tokenomics Overhaul

Project X is a comprehensive proposal aimed at refining Qubic's economic model. Key aspects include:

- **Supply Adjustment**: A mechanism to burn QUBIC tokens, effectively lowering the total supply. This is designed to potentially increase the value of remaining tokens.
- **Sustainable Financing**: Implementation of a new model to ensure long-term funding for community-driven development efforts.
- **Incentivized Holding**: Introduction of features to make holding QUBIC more attractive, potentially including staking rewards or governance rights.

**Timeline**:
- Quorum Approval: Pending (date to be determined)
- Core Implementation: Expected by end of August
- Smart Contract Proposal and Initial Public Offering (IPO): Targeted for September

### 2. Enhanced AI Integration (Aigarth)

Aigarth, Qubic's AI system, is set for significant advancements:

- **Decentralized AI Training**: Utilization of the Qubic network's computational power to create and train billions of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs).
- **Self-Improving AI**: Implementation of a "Teacher" ANN capable of modifying and improving other ANNs, with potential for recursive self-improvement.
- **Real-World Integration**: Development of Oracle Machines for environmental observation and Outsourced Computations for conducting experiments and interacting with the physical world.

### 3. Wallet Enhancements

Improvements to Qubic's wallet ecosystem are in progress:

- **Mobile Wallets**: 
  - iOS app: Recently released, undergoing continuous improvements
  - Android app: In active development, release date to be announced

- **Integration with Third-Party Wallets**:
  - Metamask Snap Wallet: Integration in progress
  - Tangem Wallet: Integration initiated
  - Heat Wallet: Integration nearing completion

### 4. Smart Contract Ecosystem Expansion

Qubic is focusing on broadening its smart contract capabilities:

- **Developer Tools**: Creation of comprehensive SDKs and documentation to facilitate easier smart contract development.
- **New Contract Types**: Development of advanced contract types such as Liquidity Pools, Name Services, and Derivatives Contracts.
- **Oracles**: Implementation of Oracle Machines to enable smart contracts to interact with real-world data.

### 5. Network Performance Optimization

Continuous efforts to enhance Qubic's network performance:
