### Milestone Tracking and Reporting

To ensure transparency and accountability, the Qubic project employs a robust system for tracking and reporting progress on these milestones:

- **Bi-weekly Updates**: The Steering Committee (SteCo) provides bi-weekly reports on the progress of ongoing milestones.
- **Community Feedback**: Regular community polls and discussions are held to gather input on milestone priorities.
- **GitHub Tracking**: Technical milestones are tracked through GitHub issues and project boards, allowing for public visibility of development progress.
- **Quarterly Reviews**: Comprehensive quarterly reviews are conducted to assess overall project advancement and adjust future milestones as needed.

### Key Dates for Project X

- August 8th: Testing of protocol extension
- August 8th: Blog post detailing the technical concepts of emissions and max cap
- August 12th: Blog post on CCF outlining how it supports ecosystem growth
- August 16th: Blog post detailing the technical concepts of the protocol extension
- Mid to late August: Launch of Protocol Extension
- September 4th: Smart contract proposals for emission model and CCF
- September 11th: Smart contract IPOs
