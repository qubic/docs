# Spectrum: The Ledger of Qubic

## Understanding the Spectrum
In the Qubic universe, the "Spectrum" signifies a critical, decentralised ledger system that preserves a transparent and tamper-proof transaction history for each epoch. Serving as an open record, the Spectrum presents a sequential record of every transaction conducted within the Qubic network per epoch.

Consider the Spectrum as a digital, transparent ledger that is accessible to anyone. This ledger meticulously logs the transaction history of each epoch in the Qubic network.

## Operation
Logging Transactions: When a transaction is executed, it is recorded as a new entry in the Spectrum. Detailed information such as the sender's and receiver's addresses and the transferred amount are logged.

Immutable Records: Upon a transaction's recording in an epoch, it cannot be altered. This immutable nature of the Spectrum ensures the accuracy and security of the network's transaction history.

## Accessibility
The Spectrum can be accessed directly on any [Computor](/learn/nodes) via the [qubic.li Spectrum Info Tool (CLI)](https://github.com/qubic-li/spectrumInfo). Make sure to use the current Qubic protocol number and the IP address of a peer in the latest tick. Check [https://app.qubic.li/network/live](https://app.qubic.li/network/live) for the latest network data.

## Security and Decentralization
The Spectrum's decentralised structure ensures that control is not vested in a single entity. Instead, the Spectrum is distributed across all Computors. This decentralisation bolsters the resistance of the Spectrum to censorship and fraudulent attempts. Alterations to the Spectrum would necessitate the consensus of the majority of Computors, making it practically impossible.


## Overview
The Spectrum, as the clear and unalterable ledger within the Qubic network, maintains a comprehensive log of transactions executed on the network per epoch. With decentralised nodes managing its consensus, the Spectrum underscores its transparency, security, and decentralisation. These characteristics solidify it as a core component of the Qubic network, fostering trust and transparency for users across the globe.
