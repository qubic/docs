## Node Types in the Qubic Network

The Qubic network consists of various node types, each playing a crucial role in maintaining the network's integrity, security, and functionality. Understanding these node types is essential for grasping the overall architecture of the Qubic ecosystem.

### 1. Computor Nodes

Computor nodes form the backbone of the Qubic network, serving as the primary validators and decision-makers.

- **Number**: There are exactly 676 Computor nodes in the network.
- **Function**: They validate transactions, execute smart contracts, and participate in the consensus mechanism.
- **Selection**: Computors are selected based on their performance in the Useful Proof-of-Work (UPoW) mining process.
- **Consensus**: A quorum of at least 451 Computors is required to implement changes, while 226 are needed to maintain the status quo.

### 2. Mining Nodes

Mining nodes contribute computational power to the network through the Useful Proof-of-Work (UPoW) system.

- **Function**: They create and submit Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) as part of the mining process.
- **Reward**: Miners receive Qubic Units (QUs) as rewards for their contributions.
- **Dual Purpose**: Mining serves both as a network security measure and a means of advancing AI capabilities through Aigarth.

### 3. Light Nodes

Light nodes provide a more accessible entry point for users to interact with the Qubic network.

- **Function**: They allow users to send and receive transactions without maintaining a full copy of the blockchain.
- **Resource Requirements**: Light nodes require fewer computational resources compared to full nodes.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for mobile wallets and applications with limited storage or processing power.

### 4. Full Nodes

Full nodes maintain a complete copy of the Qubic blockchain and play a crucial role in network decentralization.

- **Function**: They store and verify the entire blockchain history, including all transactions and smart contracts.
- **Network Support**: Full nodes contribute to the overall security and resilience of the network by independently verifying transactions.
- **Resource Intensive**: Running a full node requires more storage and processing power than light nodes.

### 5. Oracle Nodes

Oracle nodes serve as bridges between the Qubic network and external data sources.

- **Function**: They provide real-world data to smart contracts, enabling more complex and practical applications.
- **Data Verification**: Oracle nodes often employ consensus mechanisms to ensure the accuracy of the data they provide.
- **Use Cases**: Examples include providing price feeds for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications or weather data for insurance contracts.

### 6. Arbitrator Node

The Arbitrator node plays a unique role in the Qubic ecosystem, providing oversight and management functions.

- **Function**: It publishes the list of Computors, manages network parameters, and oversees the Arbitrator wallet.
- **Governance**: While it supervises the Quorum, the Arbitrator is not controlled by it, maintaining a balance of power in the network.
- **Security**: The Arbitrator's authority is distributed among multiple individuals to prevent centralization of power.

Understanding these node types and their interactions is crucial for developers, users, and stakeholders in the Qubic ecosystem. Each node type contributes to the network's overall functionality, security, and decentralization, creating a robust and versatile blockchain platform.
