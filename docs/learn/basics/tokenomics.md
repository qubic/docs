# Tokenomics

Tokenomics refers to the economic model and mechanisms governing a cryptocurrency or token within its ecosystem. In the case of Qubic, the tokenomics are designed to create a balanced and sustainable economic system that supports the network's growth and functionality.

### Qubic Units (QUs)

Qubic Units, abbreviated as QUs, are the native cryptocurrency of the Qubic ecosystem. They serve multiple crucial functions:

1. **Medium of Exchange**: QUs are used for transactions within the Qubic network.
2. **Smart Contract Fuel**: QUs power the execution of smart contracts, similar to how gas is used in other blockchain networks.
3. **Network Energy**: QUs act as "energy" within the network, facilitating various operations and processes.

#### Key Metrics

- **Circulating Supply**: 100 trillion QUs (10% of max supply)
- **Maximum Supply**: 1,000 trillion QUs (subject to change with Project X)
- **Weekly Emission**: 1 trillion QUs (subject to reduction with Project X)

### Token Generation and Distribution

#### Epoch-based Generation

Qubic operates on a weekly epoch system for token generation:

- Each epoch lasts seven days
- 1 trillion QUs are produced per epoch
- The majority of generated QUs are distributed among Computors (network validators)

#### Arbitrator Wallet

A small portion of generated QUs (approximately 1%) is allocated to the Arbitrator wallet. This serves as a "founder tax" and helps fund ecosystem development. The Arbitrator wallet employs a unique security measure:

- The wallet's seed is split between three individuals
- Each individual holds 2/3 of the seed
- Any two individuals can restore the full seed, ensuring both security and accessibility

### Token Burning Mechanism

Qubic implements a token burning mechanism to balance inflation and potentially create deflationary pressure:

- QUs are burned when used for smart contract creation and execution
- As of the latest data, 11 trillion QUs have been burned
- The burning rate has the potential to exceed the inflation rate, leading to a net deflationary effect

For example:
```
Weekly QU generation: 1 trillion
Weekly QU burning (hypothetical): 1.2 trillion
Net weekly change: -0.2 trillion (deflationary)
```

### Computor Rewards and Redistribution

The Qubic system includes a performance-based reward mechanism for Computors:

- Efficient Computors receive full rewards
- Underperforming Computors have a portion of their rewards redirected
- Redirected rewards are sent to the Arbitrator wallet

This system incentivizes high performance and ensures that network resources are utilized effectively.

### Project X: Proposed Tokenomic Changes

The Qubic team is developing a proposal called Project X, which aims to modify the current tokenomic model. The proposed changes include:

1. **Supply Reduction**: Targeting a max supply cap of 200 trillion QUBIC
2. **Emission Reduction**: Implementing a 15% reduction in emissions, followed by yearly halvings
3. **Sustainable Financing**: Implementing mechanisms for long-term community effort funding, including the Computor Controlled Fund (CCF)
4. **Increased Holding Incentives**: Introducing QEarn, a community-driven initiative offering yields for staking QUBIC

The proposed timeline for Project X is as follows:

- Core Implementation: Expected by August
- Smart Contract Proposal and Initial Public Offering (IPO): Targeted for early September
- First Emission Reduction: Planned for September 25th

These changes, if implemented, could significantly impact the token's value proposition and the overall economic structure of the Qubic ecosystem.

### Conclusion

Qubic's tokenomics model is designed to create a balanced ecosystem that supports network growth, incentivizes participation, and potentially provides value appreciation for token holders. The combination of regular token generation, performance-based distribution, and a burning mechanism creates a dynamic economic system. The proposed changes under Project X aim to further refine this model for long-term sustainability and growth. As with any cryptocurrency project, potential participants should carefully consider the tokenomic structure and its implications before engaging with the ecosystem.
