## Types of Wallets

Qubic wallets can be categorised into two main types:

1. Direct Network Connected Wallet
2. Proxied Wallet

### Direct Network Connected Wallet

This type of wallet uses a direct connection to the Qubic network. It connects to at least 3 Qubic Nodes and interacts directly with them.

Advantages:
- Most straightforward without any 3rd party software
- Mostly Open Source

Disadvantages:
- More difficult to handle
- Requires direct connection to Qubic Peers

### Proxied Wallet

A Proxied Wallet uses a proxy service to interact with the network. The proxy provider ensures that your transaction is sent to the network.

Advantages:
- Easy to handle
- Runs everywhere without direct connection to the network

Disadvantages:
- Server-Part of Software may not be Open Source
- If the proxy service is offline, you can't interact with the network
