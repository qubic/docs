# Protocol Extension

The Protocol Extension is a fundamental component of Project X, designed to enhance the flexibility and community-driven nature of the Qubic ecosystem. This technical upgrade empowers computors to play a more active role in the network's governance and resource allocation.

### Overview

The Protocol Extension is a major upgrade to the Qubic network that allows computors to allocate a percentage of their weekly earnings to proposed initiatives they believe will benefit the Qubic ecosystem. This feature enhances the decentralized nature of Qubic by giving computors more control over the network's development and resource allocation.

### Key Features

1. **Flexible Allocation**: Computors can direct a portion of their weekly emissions to various initiatives and projects.

2. **Direct Funding**: Enables the funding of smart contracts and projects directly from computor emissions.

3. **Community-Driven Decision Making**: Allows the community to have a more significant impact on the direction of the Qubic ecosystem.

4. **Adaptable Resource Distribution**: Provides the ability to shift and balance spending between various initiatives as needed.

### How It Works

1. **Emission Allocation**: Computors can send their weekly emissions directly to a Qubic ID, typically the ID of a smart contract.

2. **Voting Mechanism**: During each epoch, computors may vote on proposals from the community.

3. **Quorum Consensus**: Changes or additions require agreement from at least 451 out of 676 computors (quorum consensus).

4. **Flexible Implementation**: Allocations can be changed or added at any epoch change, subject to quorum consensus.

### Example Use Case

Under Project X, two initial proposals leveraging the Protocol Extension are:

1. Reallocation of 8% of weekly emissions to the Computor Controlled Fund (CCF)
2. Implementation of a 15% reduction in overall emissions as part of the new emission model

If approved by the computors, these allocations would be automatically distributed on a weekly basis.

### Benefits

1. **Enhanced Decentralization**: Gives computors more direct control over network resources.

2. **Increased Flexibility**: Allows for rapid adaptation to new opportunities or challenges in the ecosystem.

3. **Community Empowerment**: Enables the community to directly influence the funding of projects and initiatives.

4. **Efficient Resource Allocation**: Ensures that promising projects receive timely funding and support.

### Conclusion

The Protocol Extension represents a significant advancement in Qubic's governance and resource allocation model. By empowering computors to directly influence the allocation of network resources, Qubic is taking a major step towards a more decentralized, flexible, and community-driven ecosystem. This feature is expected to play a crucial role in shaping the future development and growth of the Qubic network.
