# Dispute Resolution (Draft)

Disputes are inevitable in any community, and Qubic is no exception. However, Qubic employs an effective dispute resolution process to ensure that disagreements are handled in a fair, transparent, and amicable manner. This approach involves several steps and emphasises community participation and consensus.

## The Arbitrator

An integral component of Qubic's dispute resolution process is the [Arbitrator](/learn/arbitrator). The Arbitrator is responsible for resolving disagreements and protecting users' interests within the Qubic ecosystem. Its key duties include setting parameters of the mining algorithm, publishing computor lists every epoch, replacing faulty computors, and accumulating QUBIC not received by poorly performing computors.

## How Does Dispute Resolution Work?

The dispute resolution process in Qubic involves the following steps:

1. **Raising a Dispute:** Any member of the Qubic community can raise a dispute if they disagree with a decision or action within the ecosystem.
2. **Community Discussion:** Once a dispute is raised, it is shared with the community for consideration. Community members can discuss the dispute, providing different perspectives and potential solutions.
3. **Arbitrator Intervention:** If the dispute cannot be resolved through community discussion, the Arbitrator intervenes. The Arbitrator reviews the dispute and makes a decision based on the rules and values of the Qubic ecosystem.
4. **Resolution:** The decision made by the Arbitrator is final and binding. Once the decision is made, the dispute is considered resolved, and all community members are expected to respect and adhere to the decision.

## Fairness and Transparency in Dispute Resolution

Qubic's dispute resolution process prioritizes fairness and transparency. It allows all community members to voice their concerns and contribute to the resolution process. The intervention of the Arbitrator ensures that an unbiased and fair decision is made, upholding the integrity and harmony of the Qubic ecosystem.
