## Community Engagement

Community engagement is a crucial aspect of the Qubic ecosystem, fostering collaboration, innovation, and decentralized governance. This section outlines the various mechanisms and initiatives that enable active participation from Qubic community members.

### Computors Controlled Fund (CCF)

The Computors Controlled Fund (CCF) is a decentralized funding mechanism that empowers the Qubic community to directly influence the project's development.

#### Key Features of CCF:

1. **Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) Structure**: The CCF operates similarly to a DAO, allowing for community-driven decision-making.

2. **Project Proposal System**: Any community member can submit proposals for projects that aim to enhance the Qubic ecosystem.

3. **Democratic Voting Process**: Proposals are selected based on community votes, ensuring that funded projects align with the collective interests of the Qubic community.

4. **Rapid Implementation**: Once approved, projects receive funding quickly, accelerating innovation within the ecosystem.

### Steering Committee (SteCo)

The Steering Committee (SteCo) plays a vital role in coordinating CCF activities and managing the ecosystem fund.

#### SteCo Responsibilities:

- Ensuring transparent governance of the CCF
- Aligning CCF activities with community interests
- Facilitating communication between the CCF and the broader Qubic community
- Guiding the strategic direction of the Qubic ecosystem
- Managing and allocating funds from the ecosystem fund
- Providing bi-weekly updates on ongoing projects and future plans
