# Use Cases

Qubic, with its unique consensus mechanism and native token QU, opens up a range of exciting possibilities for developers, businesses, and end-users. Let's explore some of the primary use cases that make Qubic a pioneering platform in the realm of distributed computing and decentralized finance.

# Decentralized Computing Power
Qubic harnesses the power of distributed systems to create a global supercomputer. Users across the globe can tap into this network for a plethora of computational needs, from running complex simulations to training AI models. Qubic's consensus mechanism ensures that the computational tasks are executed efficiently and securely, with the added benefit of utilizing underused computational resources across the globe.

# Smart Contracts
Qubic's smart contracts run on high-performance Computors, promising sub-second finality and remarkable operational speed. This not only enables developers to create more efficient decentralized applications (dApps) but also expands the potential for real-time, interactive dApps. The quorum-based consensus ensures reliable execution of smart contracts, opening up new possibilities for decentralized finance, supply chain management, gaming, and many more sectors.

# Micropayments
With its native token, QU, Qubic provides a mechanism for feeless transfers, promoting efficient micropayments. This can revolutionize industries where small transactions are frequent but often hindered by transaction fees, such as content monetization and IoT communications.

# Powering AI Training and Validation
The Qubic ecosystem utilizes Proof of Useful Work (PoUW) in training Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). This unique approach uses the computational resources involved in mining processes more effectively, by directing the power towards meaningful, real-world applications. It can significantly contribute to AI development, offering a robust and decentralized platform for training and validating AI models.

# Supply Chain and Logistics
Qubic can be a game-changer in supply chain and logistics. With its fast, secure, and scalable platform, real-time tracking and automation of supply chains become feasible. Smart contracts can be used for automatic validation and execution of agreements, reducing errors, fraud, and inefficiencies in the system.

Overall, Qubic's versatile platform unlocks a myriad of possibilities across numerous domains. Its fast, reliable, and decentralized ecosystem is geared to drive innovation and efficiency in a variety of use cases.
