# Mining Software

Understanding the software necessary to mine or finding solutions in the Qubic network (and hence earn QUs) is as important as understanding the hardware requirements. The software controls your hardware, facilitates communication with the Qubic network, and helps you manage your mining activity.

## Available Mining Software

Presently, there are a couple of software options available for mining on the Qubic network.

### Qubic-li Miner
Qubic.li offers a client that can be used to mine Qus. This software is user-friendly, making it a good choice for those new to mining. It provides essential features like managing your mining activity, monitoring performance, and connecting with the Qubic network.

### Alienminer Custom Software
The Alienminer custom software is another option available to Qubic miners. This software has been developed with a focus on performance, and it may offer certain features and optimizations not found in the Qubic.li client.

Both of these software options are actively maintained and updated to ensure the best mining performance and compatibility with the Qubic network.
